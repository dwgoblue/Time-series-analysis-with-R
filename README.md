# Time-series-analysis-with-R
This repo archived the final project we did in the UMICH STATS531 class. Specifically, we leveraged the time-series analysis tools including ARIMA, GARCH, and POMP models to fit historical volatility of NASDAQ100. In breif, the first two models were built to capture the time-series patterns based on different assumptions. The last model referring to the Breto's model considered the casual relationship among returns, volatility, and the leverage effect. This work mainly focused on statistical analysis instead of predicting and evaluated models based on likelihood values.
